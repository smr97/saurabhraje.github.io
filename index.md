# About me

## A quick insight :mag:
Hey there!   
I'm Shyamal Vaderia, currently a junior at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Pilani campus, India**, 
pursuing my B.E(Hons) in **Computer Science**.  
My journey into the realm of Computer Science evolves around writing a few lines of code that can simplify my life.
Fortunately my academic exposure has helped me to gain a deep insights. As a result, I became better at understanding and explaining
various phenomena based on simple analogies. I have gained amazing prospective to notice technology in everyday events, be it a simple
age recognition system in my phone or a fully autonomous drone flying high in the sky.
## Interests :book:
Just my baby steps into **Machine Learning** were enough to grab my interest.
**Deep Learning**, a gentle try to mimic our brain, has caught my attention when I delve deeper. 
The fact that **Artificial Intelligence** can ease our life and replace us in so many situation, is what intrigues me the most.

## The Rest of Me :v:
While not engaged in some nerdy activity, I spend my time in listening to music and playing Table Tennis.
I like to hear about people's idea and their story. Watching mind-intense movies and TV series is my favourite pastime. 
At other times I employ my teaching skill to test by helping my brother in different topics of high school Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
