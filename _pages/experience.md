# Internships
## Summer Research Internship at UST Global, Trivendrum

Worked on **Development of a decentralized firewall for malware detection using deep learning**.
Malware Detection engine was made using **Deep Belief Network (DBN)** and a decentralized firewall
system was developed using the **Ethereum block chain** network.
Data of malware and benign file was modeled as **Grey-Scale images**, where each byte of file was imagined as a greyscale pixel for the image construction.
