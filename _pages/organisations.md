## BITSACM
<small>August 2015 - Present</small>  
<small>Position held: Web Master (June 2017 - Present)</small>

BITSACM is a ACM student chapter of BITS Pilani, consisting of 70+ Computer Science enthusiasts across all the years. BITSACM has been awarded Best student chapter in India for the past 4 consecutive years.  

My journey with BITSACM has been a remarkable one. It has played an impeccable role in shaping me as a team player and an innovator.
Most of my technical work for BITSACM deals with Machine Learning, but apart from that the major work also goes into organizing Hackathons / Workshops and Managing different events with team-mates.
The values of discipline, leadership and responsibility were nurtured in me through BITSACM.

My contributions to the organization:
* As a Web Master of BITSACM, I'm handling website and online presence of BITS ACM on GitHub, facebook and twitter.
* Successfully conducted a [**`ML hackathon`**](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mapmyindia2) on kaggle in collaboration with

## National Service Scheme
<small>August 2015 - March 2016</small>  
<small>Postion held: Volunteer</small>  

National Service Scheme (NSS) is an initiative by Government of India, with primary focus on the development of personality of students through community service. NSS-Pilani now has more than 100 dedicated student volunteers working in the villages of Rajasthan to provide better educational and employment opportunities for the poor and the marginalized rural population.
As part of being a volunteer for the organization, I taught subjects like Math, Science and English to the students of nearby schools. To reinforce the learning and to make it more enjoyable I organized small fun activities that would help students grasp concepts easily.
