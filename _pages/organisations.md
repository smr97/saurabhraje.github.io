## National Service Scheme
<small>August 2015 - March 2016</small>  
<small>Postion held: Volunteer</small>  

National Service Scheme (NSS) is an initiative by Government of India, with primary focus on the development of personality of students through community service. NSS-Pilani now has more than 100 dedicated student volunteers working in the villages of Rajasthan to provide better educational and employment opportunities for the poor and the marginalized rural population.
As part of being a volunteer for the organization, I taught subjects like Math, Science and English to the students of nearby schools. To reinforce the learning and to make it more enjoyable I organized small fun activities that would help students grasp concepts easily.
